### [iOS App: Song quc](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/king-of-song-quiz/id1273605195){:target="_blank"}

A fun song guessing app, it's the first game app I've personally launched. The gameplay is simple: each round selects five songs, and the game plays a short clip from one of them. The faster a player correctly guesses the song, the higher their score will be.
