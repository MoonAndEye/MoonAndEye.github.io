## Marvin Lin

I like Apple-related products and enjoy writing in Swift. Besides Swift, I also like to write in Python. I enjoy using programming to accomplish things I love to do; my current side projects include iOS apps, macOS apps, and a Twitter bot.

### [iOS App: Song quc](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/king-of-song-quiz/id1273605195){:target="_blank"}

A fun song guessing app, it's the first game app I've personally launched. The gameplay is simple: each round selects five songs, and the game plays a short clip from one of them. The faster a player correctly guesses the song, the higher their score will be.
