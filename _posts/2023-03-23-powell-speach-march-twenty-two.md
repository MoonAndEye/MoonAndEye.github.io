summary: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced on the 22nd that the Fed has decided to raise interest rates by 1 basis point, adjusting the federal funds rate target range to 4.75% to 5%, and indicating that policy rates will reach a terminal level by the end of the year. Powell stated that this was to restore price stability and maintain public confidence in the central bank, and emphasized that the US banking system is sound and resilient enough to handle recent financial turmoil caused by multiple bank failures. His remarks disappointed the market, as investors who had expected the Fed to loosen monetary policy in response to the banking crisis began withdrawing from the US stock market. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated at a Senate hearing that she had no intention of expanding deposit insurance coverage to protect customers of troubled banks, which also triggered a sell-off in regional bank stocks and dragged down the entire financial sector. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 530 points to close at 32,030.11, the S&P 500 index fell nearly 1.7% to close at 3,936.97, and the Nasdaq Composite Index fell more than 1.6% to close at 11,669.96.

鮑爾 (Jerome Powell) 在 22 日發表的聲明中，宣布聯準會 (Fed) 決定升息 1 碼，將聯邦資金利率目標區間調高至 4.75% 至 5%，並暗示政策利率將在今年底達到終端水準。他表示，這是為了恢復物價穩定，並維持民眾對央行的信心。他也強調，美國銀行體系健全且堅韌，能夠應對近期多家銀行倒閉所引發的金融動盪。他說，央行官員不認為今年會降息，除非出現意外情況。

鮑爾的言論令市場失望，原本預期聯準會可能因應銀行業危機而放寬貨幣政策的投資人紛紛撤離美股市場。另一方面，財政部長葉倫 (Janet Yellen) 在參議院聽證會上表示，她無意擴大存款保險範圍，以保障問題銀行的客戶。她的言論也引發區域銀行股的崩跌，拖累整個金融板塊。道瓊指數終場重挫 530 點，收在 32,030.11 點；標普 500 指數跌近 1.7%，收在 3,936.97 點；那斯達克綜合指數跌逾 1.6%，收在 11,669.96 點。
