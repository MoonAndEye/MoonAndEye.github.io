## 開始使用 Bard

bard 現在只能接受英文，所以我這邊的問題都是用英文問的。

### 問新聞

### 問股價

問了 Bard 能不能預測今晚 AAPL 的股價。回應是不行。

### 改問 AAPL 財報資料

改問已經發生的歷史資料，他可以回答出財報，包含數字。

### 問一下台積電工廠的地址

非常詳細啊，連廠房的名字都列上來了，看名字大概也知道哪個地址上的工廠是做哪一段半導體製程的。(不過，這應該是新聞都有報的)

### 問 Android 和 iPhone 誰賣得比較好

這邊也給的出數字，而且數字也的確來自另一份報告。

給出很穩健的標的， AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, TSLA

The company is known for its innovative products, such as the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Apple is also a major player in the services industry, with its App Store, Apple Music, and Apple Pay.

## 試用心得

Bard 在問像是餐廳等資訊時，我查起來是有這些餐廳的。然後在數字的表現上，不會有很大的誤差。
