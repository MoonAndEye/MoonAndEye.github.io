Craft and Quality, and professional grade software.

To me craft is mindset, and quality is the output.

If you think of anything that was built or created, and well done, it’s probably because they cared
and they knew their craft. They designed it well. They iterated and prototyped. They chose the
right materials. They built it well. It’s very easy to see when the person doesn't care. The work is

sloppy. There are mistakes. It works and likely breaks down very quickly.

And | think as a software industry the past decade we kind of forgot the craft. More stuff look
like something where people didn’t care about the craft. We focused on building larger teams.
We then made them run like factories churning out new things at a consistent pace. We validated

“quality” by A/B testing and looking at metrics. Lot of software today borderline works.

But we are supposed to be professionals and real companies. We're selling products to people
to buy. | think our responsibility is to deliver good products and quality products, not something

that is sloppy.

Craft is the mindset that creates quality. But it’s not enough. You need to have the right skills and
ideas. You need individuals who take their profession and craft seriously, then build teams that
work this way together, and have a company that creates for it. Not only incentivizing with

deadlines and metrics, but also caring if the experience is good enough.

Especially professional software should be “professional grade”. Professional grade tools and
appliances are often more durable, more powerful, more precise and focused. Professional grade
software should be that way too. It should be more or less bug free. It should be fast. It should
meet the needs of the customers.

The pushback is always “well how do you measure quality”. There isn’t an easy answer or a single
measurement, it’s going to be hard, but it is possible. You first have to believe in it, then
encourage teams to do it, and the way you validate is by listening to what the market and

customers say. Depending on the business there can be measurements.

For us @linear it’s always been anecdotal. Linear is used daily in the companies and we hear a lot
of feedback. They send notes how great the product or a new feature is. People tweet about it.
CEO/founders sometimes tell me that they picked Linear because the product experience is so
good that they use it to inspire their teams to do the same. VCs tell me how their portfolio

companies rave about Linear and bring it up in the conversations.

As you listen to these signals, you start to see if the quality is there or not. But even when you
hear the signals, you can’t stop. Great products require consistent, daily effort keeping the

quality.
In short, people aren’t organically raving about your product, you probably don’t have a great
product yet. Maybe you have just an OK product. If you have a great product, people will talk

about it.

Great products create fans and champions. In my mind product quality is the ultimate moat.

手藝與品質，以及專業級軟體。

對我來說，手藝是一種心態，品質是其產出。

如果你想到任何被建造或創造出來且做得很好的事物，那很可能是因為他們在乎他們的手藝。他們設計得很好。他們進行反覆的迭代和原型製作。他們選擇了合適的材料。他們建造得很好。當一個人不在乎時，這是非常容易看出的。工作做得馬虎，有錯誤。它能運作但很可能很快就會故障。

我認為，在過去十年的軟體產業中，我們有點忘記了手藝。更多的產品看起來像是人們不在乎手藝的產物。我們專注於擴建更大的團隊。然後讓他們像工廠一樣持續不斷地生產新事物。我們通過A/B測試和看指標來驗證「品質」。今天很多軟體僅僅是勉強能用。

但我們應該是專業人士和真正的公司。我們銷售的是讓人們購買的產品。我認為我們的責任是提供好的產品和高品質的產品，而不是那些做工粗糙的產品。

手藝是創造品質的心態。但這還不夠。你需要擁有正確的技能和想法。你需要那些認真對待自己的職業和手藝的人，然後建立這樣合作的團隊，並擁有一個為此創造的公司。不僅僅是用期限和指標作為激勵，還要關心體驗是否足夠好。

尤其是專業軟體應該是「專業級」的。專業級工具和設備通常更耐用、更強大、更精確且更專注。專業級軟體也應該如此。它應該基本無錯、運行快速、能滿足客戶的需求。

對於品質的反饋總是「你如何衡量品質」。沒有簡單的答案或單一的衡量方式，這將是困難的，但這是可能的。你首先必須相信它，然後鼓勵團隊去做，而你驗證的方式是聽取市場和客戶的說法。根據業務的不同，可以有相應的衡量標準。

對我們 @linear 來說，它總是一種軼事。Linear 在公司中每天都被使用，我們收到很多反饋。他們發送說明產品或新功能有多好的筆記。人們在推特上談論它。首席執行官/創始人有時告訴我，他們之所以選擇 Linear，是因為產品體驗非常好，他們用它來激勵他們的團隊做同樣的事情。風險投資者告訴我，他們的投資組合公司如何熱衷於 Linear 並在談話中提起它。

當你聽到這些信號時，你開始看到品質是否存在。但即使你聽到了這些信號，你也不能停止。優秀的產品需要持續的、日常的努力來維持品質。

總之，如果人們不是自然地狂熱於你的產品，你可能還沒有一個偉大的產品。也許你只有一個還可以的產品。如果你有一個偉大的產品，人們會談論它。

偉大的產品創造粉絲和冠軍。在我看來，產品品質是最終的護城河。
