summary: Credit Suisse Group, one of Switzerland's two major banking groups, has announced that it will be acquired by rival UBS Group in an all-stock transaction worth CHF 30 billion ($32.5 billion). The acquisition, which was heavily supported by the Swiss government and central bank, aims to prevent a crisis of confidence from threatening the global financial market. Credit Suisse has been struggling with multiple financial scandals and losses, including losses from partnering with Greensill Capital and Archegos Capital Management. The deal will make UBS one of the largest wealth management companies in the world and ends Credit Suisse's 167-year history.

## Applying for a ChatGPT API Key

ChatGPT offers an open API for users to integrate, with a free usage limit of $18 USD or a three-month expiry, after which an upgrade to Plus is required for continued use. For accurate and up-to-date information, it's recommended to follow the OpenAI website.

### [OpenAI Pricing Page](https://openai.com/pricing)

Now, let's start integrating ChatGPT. To connect with the client, we need an API key.

### [API Key Application Page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

You can apply for an API key on this page. Remember, once you receive the key, store it immediately as you won't be able to see it again.

**This page also reminds you not to store the API key on the client-side or in public repositories**

Next, we will continuously ask ChatGPT how to connect to ChatGPT.

## Using ChatGPT to Connect to ChatGPT

```
Question:
How to connect to ChatGPT
```

```
Answer:
To use the ChatGPT API, follow these steps:

1. Register for a ChatGPT API account. Go to the official ChatGPT API website, click the 'Register' button, and fill in the required registration information.

2. Create an API key. After logging into your ChatGPT API account, create a new API key. The API key is your unique credential to connect to the ChatGPT API and is required to access API services.

3. Choose the appropriate API. ChatGPT API offers several API features, such as text generation, conversation systems, language translation, etc. Select the API that fits your needs.

4. Create an API request. Using your API key and the appropriate API endpoint, create an API request. An API endpoint is the URL of the API service, which can be found in the API documentation. In your API request, you can pass the corresponding parameters and data to access the API service.

5. Handle the API response. Once you send the API request, you will receive a response containing the results returned by the API service. You can proceed based on the data in the response.

These are the general steps for using the ChatGPT API. You can refer to the official ChatGPT API documentation for more details about the API and make integration easier by using relevant libraries and SDKs.
```

```
Question:
Give me an example of connecting to ChatGPT.
```

```
Answer:
Sure, here is a simple example using the Python language, using the ChatGPT API text generation feature:

import openai
import os

# Set the API key
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Prepare the API request
prompt = "Once upon a time,"
model_engine = "text-davinci-002"
temperature = 0.5
max_tokens = 50

# Access the API service
response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine=model_engine,
    prompt=prompt,
    max_tokens=max_tokens,
    temperature=temperature,
)

# Handle the API response
generated_text = response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Output the result
print(generated_text)
This example generates a piece of text that continues from the prompt "Once upon a time," using the ChatGPT API text generation feature. In this example, we use the openai Python package and set the API key as an environment variable. We use the openai.Completion.create method to submit a text generation request to the API service and obtain the generated text result by processing the API response.
```

## Directly Running the Code

Let's see what happens if we take the code provided by ChatGPT, replace the API key as instructed, and run it.

```
# Result

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/xyz/5python/foo.py", line 14, in <module>
    response = openai.Completion.create(
  File "/Users/xyz/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/openai/api_resources/completion.py", line 25, in create
    return super().create(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/Users/xyz/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/openai/api_resources/abstract/engine_api_resource.py", line 149, in create
    ) = cls.__prepare_create_request(
  File "/Users/xyz/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/openai/api_resources/abstract/engine_api_resource.py", line 106, in __prepare_create_request
    requestor = api_requestor.APIRequestor(
  File "/Users/xyz/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/openai/api_requestor.py", line 130, in __init__
    this.api_key = key or util.default_api_key()
  File "/Users/xyz/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/openai/util.py", line 186, in default_api_key
    raise openai.error.AuthenticationError(
openai.error.AuthenticationError: No API key provided. You can set your API key in code using 'openai.api_key = <API-KEY>', or you can set the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY=<API-KEY>). If your API key is stored in a file, you can point the openai module at it with 'openai.api_key_path = <PATH>'. You can generate API keys in the OpenAI web interface. See https://onboard.openai.com for details, or email support@openai.com if you have any questions.
```

We get an AuthenticationError, which clearly indicates an issue with the API key setup. For now, let's not manually intervene and see if ChatGPT can provide a corrected code from this result.

## Asking ChatGPT with the Error Result

```

# Answer:
This error message indicates that the ChatGPT API key was not provided in the code. You need to set your API key to use the ChatGPT API. You can follow these steps:

Visit the OpenAI Console (https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart)
Create an account (if you don't already have one)
Create a new API key (https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication/create-api-key)
Copy your new API key
Set `openai.api_key` in your code to your API key.
Here is an example code snippet:
```

```

python
Copy code
import openai

# Set your API key
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

# Call the ChatGPT API text generation feature
prompt = "Once upon a time,"
model_engine = "text-davinci-002"
temperature = 0.5
max_tokens = 50

response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine=model_engine,
    prompt=prompt,
    max_tokens=max_tokens,
    temperature=temperature,
)

# Handle

the API response
generated_text = response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Output the result
print(generated_text)
Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual ChatGPT API key.
```

This time, ChatGPT replaced the section for setting the API key:

```
# Before replacement
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# After replacement
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Then, running it again, we received:

```
# Response:
"There was a little girl who loved to read. She would spend hours upon hours reading books of all kinds. She loved the smell of old books and the way they made her feel.

One day, she came across a book that she had"
```

This resulted in a story continuation because our prompt was "Once upon a time," so ChatGPT followed it up with a story.

## Parameters of the ChatGPT API

```
prompt = "Once upon a time,"
model_engine = "text-davinci-002"
temperature = 0.5
max_tokens = 50
```

### Prompt
This is the input text that ChatGPT uses to generate a response.

### Model Engine
This specifies the AI model used. Different models are suited for different tasks, so it's recommended to select the model that best fits your needs from the official website. Note that although ChatGPT provided `text-davinci-002`, there are newer models like `text-davinci-003` and `gpt-3.5-turbo` released after March 2023. Each model has different capabilities, so adjust according to your use case.

### Temperature
This parameter controls the variability of the response. Setting it to 0 means the same input always produces the same output. Increasing the temperature allows for more varied responses.

### Max Tokens
This limits the length of the response. Each model has different maximum tokens, so setting it to 500, 1000, or more is possible. Be aware that this affects usage costs, as tokens are how usage is calculated. Pricing details are listed in the reference material below.
