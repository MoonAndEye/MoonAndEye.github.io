Before a new version of an iOS app can be launched on the App Store, it must undergo Apple's review process. After the review, but before pressing the 'Publish' button, there are still some items that can be edited. Here are a few:

### Change the release method from manual to automatic on a specified date

You can change this if it was initially set to manual during submission. If it was set to auto-release, it will release immediately.
