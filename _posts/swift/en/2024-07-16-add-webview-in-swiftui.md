In today's apps, features that communicate with the web are fundamental. This article will add a WebView page to the app that links to Grace Hopperâ€™s Wikipedia page. This ensures that the information accessed is consistent with what's on Wikipedia, without needing to update the client side every time thereâ€™s new information.

### How to Use WebView in SwiftUI

Currently, SwiftUI does not have a WebView component, so we need to use WebKitâ€™s WKWebView. Bridging SwiftUI with UIKit is straightforward: make the component conform to `UIViewRepresentable`, then implement `makeUIView(:)` and `updateUIView(:,:)`. This allows the use of UIKit components.

Inside this `WKWebViewContainer`, we will place a URL that the WKWebView will use to load the URLRequest.

```swift
import WebKit

struct WKWebViewContainer: UIViewRepresentable {
    
    var url: URL
    
    func makeUIView(context: Context) -> WKWebView {
        return WKWebView()
    }
    
    func updateUIView(_ webView: WKWebView, context: Context) {
        let request = URLRequest(url: url)
        webView.load(request)
    }
}
```

Wrap the `WKWebViewContainer` so that other SwiftUI components can be added around it.

```swift
struct MyWebView: View {
  
  let urlString: String
  
  var body: some View {
    
    if let url = URL(string: urlString) {
      WKWebViewContainer(url: url)
    } else {
      Text("not a url")
    }
  }
}
```

Hmmâ€¦ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”Â If the URL can't be parsed, the current code will display a Text, which seems odd. Let's add an Error View then.

For the image, you can directly use the SF Symbol `wifi.exclamationmark`, no need to search for additional assets.

SF Symbols website, where you can download the SF Symbols app.

```swift
// If the URLString is incorrect, an Error view will appear
struct URLNotCorrectView: View {
  
  var body: some View {
    
    VStack {
      Image(systemName: "wifi.exclamationmark")
        .font(.system(size: 150))
        .padding()
      Text("Oops! Internet got error")
        .bold()
        .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
        .font(.system(size: 44))
    }
  }
}
```

Finally, `MyWebView` looks like this:

```swift
struct MyWebView: View {
  
  let urlString: String
  
  var body: some View {
    
    if let url = URL(string: urlString) {
      WKWebViewContainer(url: url)
    } else {
      URLNotCorrectView()
    }
  }
}
```

However, you can't see the webpage in the preview, so at the entry point, we change the View to `MyWebView` to see the result.

```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct DemoApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
          MyWebView(urlString: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper")
        }
    }
}
```

You can also intentionally insert a string that is not a URL; if it cannot be converted into a URL, the previously written network error View will appear.
