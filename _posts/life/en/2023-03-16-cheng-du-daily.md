# Chengdu, China - The Land of Abundance

This article was written in 2011, and all observations are based on that time.

### Chengdu Train Station - Always Crowded

Due to various reasons, my business trip was delayed until mid-June. The weather in Chengdu at that time was quite pleasant, cool, and not too humid. The factory was newly built, and many areas were still empty. Interestingly, the whole complex was divided into two sections: North and South, separated by a highway. Unfortunately, there was no pedestrian bridge between them, forcing employees to risk crossing the highway, which sometimes led to accidents. Hopefully, this issue has been addressed since then.

## Are Chengdu Women More Beautiful?

Google returns about 21,100,000 search results for this question. From my observations in offices, production lines, and nearby schools, I’d say South China has lost this competition. Most Chengdu women have delicate, sharp facial features, with big eyes and small lips. The reason behind this remains a mystery, but it’s a fascinating phenomenon.

Chengdu women not only have striking appearances but also work diligently. In contrast to South China, where men dominate labor-intensive tasks, women in Chengdu are often seen operating CNC machines. Supervisors even mentioned that female workers generally show better discipline and compliance.

### Mahjong Culture

Mahjong is extremely popular in this region, and tea houses are abundant. Many businesses turn into mahjong rooms at night. However, the rules here differ from Taiwan's 16-tile game. Chengdu uses only 108 tiles, excluding East, South, West, North, and honor tiles, making the game faster and more unpredictable.

## Sichuan Cuisine - Peppers & Spice

Although Shenzhen is in Guangdong, Hunan and Jiangxi cuisine dominate. Chengdu, however, uses Sichuan peppercorns, which provide a numbing sensation rather than just spiciness. The distinct tingling effect instantly makes it clear when you're eating authentic Sichuan cuisine.

## Wuhou Shrine & Jinli Street

Adjacent to Wuhou Shrine is Jinli, a street filled with Three Kingdoms-themed merchandise. Chengdu, once known as "Shu," has deeply embraced this history, with characters like Liu Bei, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Zhuge Liang immortalized in statues and souvenirs.

Small theaters nearby showcase traditional performances, including face-changing acts and tea art demonstrations. These performances allow the audience to experience the intricate skills of Chinese tea-making and Sichuan opera up close.
