## Flights

Flights from Taiwan to Prague operate directly on Tuesdays and Saturdays. The return journey can be from Vienna, which also offers a direct flight to Taipei. Currently, only China Airlines offers direct flights between Taipei and Prague. If you prefer layovers, there are many alternatives.

## Public Transport in Prague

Tickets are available at vending machines at the airport, allowing easy access to the city center.

### Prague Transport Tickets

Prague's public transport system uses time-based tickets. Options include 30-minute, 24-hour, and 72-hour tickets. If you plan to take three or more trips in a day, a 24-hour ticket is more economical.

## Public Transport in Vienna

For city travel, 24-hour and 72-hour tickets are available. It is recommended to buy them via mobile apps for convenience. However, note that ticket validity starts immediately upon purchase, so buy it just before your first use.

## Currency

- Prague: Czech Koruna (CZK)
- Vienna: Euro (EUR)
- Budapest: Hungarian Forint (HUF)

Although these countries use different currencies, euros are generally accepted, though at less favorable exchange rates. Apple Pay and Google Pay are widely accepted for transportation payments. However, some restaurants only accept cash, often due to temporary POS machine issues.
