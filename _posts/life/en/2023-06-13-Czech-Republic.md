# The Bone Church - Czech Republic (This Post Contains Real Human Bone Photos, View with Caution)

Before the throne of God, nobles and commoners are all the same.

The Bone Church, located in the small town of Kutná Hora, is about an hour's train ride east of Prague. This town is home to Sedlec Ossuary, the Church of the Assumption, and even a Foxconn factory.

### Origins - A Sacred Land

The ossuary was built in the 14th century after a monk brought soil from Jerusalem and scattered it over the site, making it sacred. As a result, many aristocrats sought to be buried here. The Black Death and wars in the 15th century filled the site with remains, leading the church to store bones inside.

### Artistic Bone Arrangement

In the late 1800s, the Schwarzenberg family hired a woodcarver, Rint, to arrange the bones into intricate decorations. His work includes chandeliers, coats of arms, and other motifs crafted from approximately 40,000 human bones. Rint even signed his name using bones.

### The Schwarzenberg Coat of Arms

One striking display is the Schwarzenberg coat of arms, featuring a raven pecking at a defeated Turkish soldier’s eye. This symbolizes the family's victory over the Ottomans.

### A Reflection on Mortality

The massive bone pyramid in the church leaves a deep impression. It serves as a stark reminder that in death, all are equal—kings, knights, and commoners alike. Standing before it, one can't help but ponder the fleeting nature of life and the importance of making the most of our time.

Visiting Sedlec Ossuary is both an eerie and awe-inspiring experience. It forces one to confront mortality while admiring the artistic craftsmanship that has preserved the memory of thousands who rest within its walls.
