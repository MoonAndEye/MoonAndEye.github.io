One day, on a whim, I wanted to see if I could find a cheap Bitcoin miner. I searched on Shopee and found a Bitcoin lottery miner, which perfectly met my needs.

This type of miner is about the size of a USB flash drive but slightly thicker. Once plugged in, set up Wi-Fi and a wallet, and it starts mining.

It makes almost no noise and doesn’t generate much heat. Since the hashrate is low, it doesn’t get hot, and the electricity cost is under $5 per month.
